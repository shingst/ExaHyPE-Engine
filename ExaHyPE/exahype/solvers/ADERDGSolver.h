/**
 * ADER-DG solver base class.
 *
 *
 * Mesh Refinement
 * ===============
 *
 * Some notes on the solver which will hopefully grow into a full documentation.
 *
 * - The user uses a RefinementControl to steer the refinement automation implemented
 *   by this solver. The time stepping is only stopped if refinement is requested.
 *
 * - We perform rollbacks after the mesh refinement as we assume that the
 *   mesh refinement is always triggered to late by the user (a-posteriori refinement).
 *   We thus have to check if we can erase the current and the previous solution.
 *
 * - The refinement automaton uses a RefinementEvent to track the state of
 *   each cell. The automata of different cells interplay when
 *   refining or erasing of cells is performed.
 *
 * - In order to prevent refinement/erasing oscillations, we restrict the
 *   solution and previousSolution to the parent and evaluate the refinement
 *   criterion for both. Only if no refinement is triggered, the
 *   erasing is actually performed.
 *
 * - On the finest level, we evaluate the refinement criterion but we also
 *   spread a status for halo refinement. A cells refinement decision making
 *   is thus depending on two inputs. We combine both information
 *   into a refinement status. We choose always the maximum
 *   value of the inputs.
 *   The hybrid limiter solver further injects the limiter status into
 *   the refinement status.
 *
 * Subsequently, we list refinement "stories" cell descriptions of this solver
 * might "experience".
 *
 * Safe, Oscillation-Free Erasing of Child Cells
 * ---------------------------------------------
 *
 * This procedure can take up to 3 iterations.
 *
 * 1. All children (type: Cell) of a cell (type: Ancestor) want to be erased.
 * They have the refinement status Erase. In the previous iteration, they
 * had this refinement status, too. (adjustSolutionDuringMeshRefinementBody -> markForRefinement)
 * They write their max refinement status to the parent (progressMeshRefinementInEnterCell->updateCoarseGridAncestorRefinementStatus).
 * (If one of them is an Ancestor itself, they set an erasing children veto flag which is reset by
 * the parent in every iteration.)
 *
 * 2. The parent (type: Ancestor) changes its type to Cell and allocates
 * the necessary memory. (progressMeshRefinementInLeaveCell->progressCollectiveRefinementOperationsInLeaveCell)
 * The parent notifies its children by setting the ErasingChildrenRequested RefinementEvent.
 *
 * 3.The children restrict their volume data (solution and previous solution) up to the parent. They
 * do not delete their data yet. (progressMeshRefinementInLeaveCell->restrictVolumeDataIfErasingChildrenRequested)
 *
 * 4. The parent evaluates the refinement criterion for current solution and previous solution.
 * If one of the evaluations indicates that refining is necessary, the children erasing
 * process is stopped and the parent changes its type back to Ancestor. (progressMeshRefinementInLeaveCell->progressCollectiveRefinementOperationsInLeaveCell)
 * During the mesh refinement iterations, it stores the current and previous refinement status in order
 * to prevent the procedure to start again.
 *
 * If no refinement at both time stages is required, the parent keeps its new type (Cell) and signals its children to delete
 * themselves. It does this by changing the RefinementEvent from ErasingChildrenRequested -> ErasingChildren.
 *
 * 5. The parent resets its status to None.
