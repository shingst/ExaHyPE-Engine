/**
 * <h2>Writing CarpetHDF5 files which are compatible to Cactus/EinsteinToolkit</h2>
 * 
 * This writer produces files similar to the CarpetHDF5 file format. This file format is
 * produced by the https://www.carpetcode.org/ Carpet code for http://cactuscode.org/ Cactus
 * by the http://einsteintoolkit.org/ Einsteintoolkit.
 *
 * By using this writer, users can use their Cactus postprocessing tools seamless with ExaHyPE
 * output without even knowing. There are also readers included into Visit and Amira for
 * opening the CarpetHDF5 file format.
 *
 * <h3>Output format variants</h3>
 * 
 * The writer has two major flags to trigger the way how H5 files are produced:
 * 
 * <strong> oneFilePerTimestep </strong> mimics the way how ExaHyPE produces VTK files: There is
 * always (at least) one file per timestep. This is <em>not</em> the way how the CarpetHDF5 file
 * format works and you will have to join the HDF5 files with tools like h5join (shipped with
 * Carpet/Cactus) in order to read these files with ordinary writers. Nevertheless this is helpful
 * for debugging or immediately opening single timestep snapshots in Visit.
 * 
 * <strong> allUnknownsInOneFile </strong> allows you to reduce the number of H5 files by putting
 * the (vector of) all written unknowns in a single file. This also mimics how ExaHyPE's VTK files
 * look like. In contrast, in Cactus one typically has one hdf5 file per group/per physical field.
 * This allows easily to copy only the interesting fields from a supercomputer.
 *
 * <h3>General limitations</h3>
 * 
 * <strong> MPI support not yet completed </strong>. We plan two modes:
 *   (1) Standard approach: Each MPI rank produces its own file
 *   (2) One file is created accross all ranks (HDF5 should provide easy methods to do so).
 * In any way, you find tools at Miscellaneous/CarpetHDF5-Utils to merge several files to a single
 * one, distribute data, or as you whish.
 *
 * <strong> Structure of array vs. array of structures </strong>
 * The CarpetHDF5 file format directly resembles the closest way how to dump Cactus memory into files.
 * Cactus stores structures of arrays, for instance the four hydro variables {rho,velx,vely,velz,eps}
 * are stored as four big arrays in Cactus. In contrast, ExaHyPE stores arrays of structures, hence
 * in principle one big array where at each point there are the four variables. For this very reason,
 * producing CarpetHDF5 files comes with a lot of overhead, ie. a needless amount of over and over
 * repeated metadata and way too much components.
 *
 * By no means this is the fault of the HDF5 binary table format but really the way how CarpetHDF5
 * works or can be "maximally streched" to also fit ExaHyPE in.
 * 
 * <strong>Always vertex-centered data</strong>
 * As the Finite Differencing code Cactus uses by default vertex-centered data and stores them as
 * such, the data layout only supports vertex data and not cell-centered data. Maybe the actual
 * CarpetHDF5 format supports also cell-centered representation.
 * 
 * <h3>A note about time</h3>
 * Since there is no global timestep counter in ExaHyPE (in contrast to Cactus, where the steps
 * on the finest level are counted), the timesteps are just counting the plotting invocations
 * (the "plotting steps", similar as they are counted in the VTK plotters, for instance). That
 * means the number has no physical meaning (there is no equation time = dt * timestep)
 * 
 * <h3>How to build the CarpetHDF5 plotters into your release</h3>
 * 
 * By default, the HDF5 plotters are excluded from compiling. If you enable it in your spec file, the code
 * will stop at startup, throwing a message that this plotter is not supported.
 * 
 * In order to use these plotters, define "HDF5" and provide the HDF5 serial C++ header path and
 * libraries. This can be done by adding to your project
 *

 * This snippet works on a standard Ubuntu system with hdf5 developer libraries installed.
 * I extracted them from "h5cc -show" and "pkg-config --libs hdf5"
 * 
 * <h3>Connection to other plotters in ExaHyPE</h3>
 *
 * Actually this plotter is quite similar to the CartesianVTK format but just with regular
 * block patches. It is also similar to the new PeanoPatchFileFormat which was developed
 * in the same time.
 *
 * Thanks to Roland Haas for support in Munich and Frankfurt when coming up with the file format.
