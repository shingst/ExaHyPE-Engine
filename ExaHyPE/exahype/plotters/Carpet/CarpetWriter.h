   * Construct a new CarpetWriter.
   * 
   * @arg _filename   Basis filename template to use for constructing output
   *                  filenames. This should be without extension or slicing
   *                  information (suffix like "it4-rank3.xyz.h5" will be added).
   * @arg _basisSize  The number of nodes to write. Note, the CarpetWriter is agnostic
   *                  for the underlying scheme. It always writes vertex data.
   * @arg _solverUnknowns  State vector length in the solver (stored for setting up the correct striping)
   * @arg _writtenUnknowns Output vector length
   * @arg _plotterParameters  View on the specfile, allows for runtime parameter estimation
   * @arg writtenQuantitiesNames   Can be provided by postProcessing
   * 
   * The following settings are extracted from the plotterParameters:
   * 
   * oneFilePerTimestep: You might want to have this to view the result during computation
   *     as HDF5 is very lazy at writing. Note that writing out data this form is not compilant
   *     with most CarpetHDF5 readers (ie. the visit reader). You must join seperate files afterwards
   *     manually.
   * 
   * allUnknownsInOneFile: Write different fields in a single combined file. Typically for Cactus
   *     as structure of arrays is to write each unknown in its own file (ie. one file per physical field).
   *
   * For most comments, see also the documentation in the ADERDG2Carpet.h. Note that
   * the ASCII writer was written after the HDF5 writer and is more a hack.
