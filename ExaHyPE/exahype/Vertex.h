   *

   *
   * Shared Memory
   * =============
   * 
   * All vertices can be processed race-free in parallel if each vertex only
   * performs Riemann solves/neighbour merges around a single adjacent cell.
   * This ensures a unique mapping between the vertices and the faces of the mesh
   * and prevents that two threads access the same face data simulutaneously.
   * 
   * In the sketch below, Vertex a only merges neighbours adjacent to cell 0.
   * The interfaces are annotated with A. Analgously, vertices b and c
   * only perform merges at faces annotated with B and C, respectively.
   *
   * --C--c
   *      |
   *   2  C  3   
   *      |    
   * --A--a--B--b
   *      |     |
   *   0  A  1  B
   *      |     |
   * 
   * This works as all cells are sounded by vertices. At the boundary, some vertices
   * will have less work associated with them as some of their adjacent faces are outside of the domain.
   * 
   * We let every vertex do the Riemann solves around the cell at position 0 in the vertex' local adjacency map.
   * The cell's neigbour merge partners are at positions 1,2, (2D and 3D) and 4 (only 3D).
   *
   * Background Jobs and neighbourMergePerformed flags
   * --------------------------------------------------
   * The Riemann solves wait if a background job has not completed
   * in one of the cells adjacent to a face.
   * We rely here on information if a face has already been
   * processed or not. Otherwise, we may wait
   * on a neighbour which has already advanced in time
   * and submitted the next background job.
   * This would introduce numerical errors.
   *
   *
   * Old implemtation (still used for MPI routine)
   * ---------------------------------------------
   *
   * The AvoidFineGridRaces multithreading touchVertexFirstTime
   * specification prevents that more than one threads write data for
   * the same face of the grid at the same time.
   *
   * The specification is realised by touching the vertices in
   * a red-black (X and O in the figure below) manner:
   * We might first process the X-vertices in parallel
   * and then the O-vertices.
   * In each step, faces adjacent to the vertices,
   * do not overlap and race conditions can thus
   * not occur.
   *
   *     |    |
   *     |    |
   * ----O----X-----
   *     |    |
   *     |    |
   * ----X----O-----
   *     |    |
   *     |    |
   *
   * Further parallelisation over the adjacent faces
   * -----------------------------------------------
   *
   * Further concurrency can be found in the loops over the adjacent
   * faces per vertex. In 2D, 3D, there are 4, 12 faces ,respectively,
   * which can be processed in parallel. A face is defined
   * by its adjacent cells:
   *
   * Adjacency index pairs in 2D:
   *
   * face between positions [0,0]-[1,0]: adjacency index pairs 0-1
   * face between positions [0,0]-[0,1]: adjacency index pairs 0-2
   * face between positions [1,0]-[1,1]: adjacency index pairs 1-3
   * face between positions [0,1]-[1,1]: adjacency index pairs 2-3
   *
   * Adjacency index pairs in 3D:
   *
   * face between positions [0,0,0]-[1,0,0]: adjacency index pairs 0-1
   * face between positions [0,0,0]-[0,1,0]: adjacency index pairs 0-2
   * face between positions [0,0,0]-[0,0,1]: adjacency index pairs 0-4
