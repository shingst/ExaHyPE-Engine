/**
 * Returns the exact (point-wise) interpoland for position for x

 * If you interpolate onto a equidistant grid, you can alternatively use the
 * array equidistantGridProjector1d that holds all mapping quantities in a
 * precomputed table and thus is faster.
 *
 * @param offsetOfPatch Array of doubles of size DIMENSIONS. If you use
 *          Peano's tarch::la::Vector class, apply its data() function to
 *          get hold of a pointer to be passed into this function
 * @param x Position where to evaluate the function. This has to be a point
 *          within the patch
 * @param numberOfUnknowns Number of unknowns held per grid point withint the
 *          patch
 * @param unknown Which unknown to evaluate
 * @param order   Which order is used
 * @param u       Pointer to unknowns
