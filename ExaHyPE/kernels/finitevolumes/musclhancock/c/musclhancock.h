   * The MUSCl-Hancock implementation follows "13.4.2 The MUSCL–Hancock Method (MHM)" in
   * E.F. Toro's book "Riemann solvers and numerical methods for fluid dynamics: a practical introduction",
   * 3rd ed. Dordrecht ; New York: Springer, 2009.
   *
   * Modifications:
   *
   * - The ghost layers have width two. This allows us to perform only one communication step but
   *   results in more work per patch as some slopes have to be computed twice.
   *
   * - Corner/edge volumes are not communicated yielding a star stencil (+).
   *   Therefore, certain slopes in ghost cells adjacent to
   *   diagonal or edge neighbours can either not be (i) reconstructed
   *   and set to zero, or (ii) they are reconstructed based on only
   *   2 out of 3 cells which means they are not limited.
   *
   *   If robustDiagonalLimiting=false, the implementation follows approach (i).
   *   If robustDiagonalLimiting=false, the implementation follows approach (ii).
   *
   *   Discussion:
   *
   *   Strategy (i) might be the better approach in terms of mass conservation and
   *   limiting unphysical oscillations but formally reduces the order of accuracy
   *   compared to (ii).
   *
   *   A third approach would be to estimate slope_ij_x as slope_ij_x ~ ( u_{i,j}-u_{i+1,j-1} )
   *   if neighbour value u_{i+1,j} is not available, where ghost cell u_{ij} is
   *   available from a face neighbour, and ghost cell u_{i+1,j-1} is
   *   available from another face neighbour.
   *   As diagonal neighbours compute the same slope this way,
   *   mass conservation is guaranteed.
   *   However, this approach will increase dispersion errors as the slopes
   *   are only estimated and, furthermore, also does not limit
   *   unphysical oscillations.
   *
   * Issues with approach (ii):
   *
   * - Users experienced zero-valued states when performing PDE operations.
   *   Simply ignoring these states seemd to help. This might imply that these
   *   bad states are found in the ghost layers. Likely, the interface states are the bad states.
   *   Debugging should start here.
   *
   * @param solver a user solver implementing the PDE kernels
   * @param luh_new the evolved solution
   * @param luh     the current (old) solution
   * @param dx      the dimensions of a cell
   * @param dt      the used time step size
   * @return the actual admissible time step size obtained from the Riemann solves.
